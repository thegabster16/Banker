# Banker

#This program is a command line run banking system that has predetermined bank accounts and pin numbers and displays a menu with five options

#This project was a personal project to use C# and slowly implement more and more complex features after creating the basic features

#The five menu options are:
  1) View account balance
  2) Deposit money into the account
  3) Withdraw money from the account
  4) Give transaction history
  5) Exit the program

#The program closes if an account is not found or there is an incorrect pin number given for the associated account
